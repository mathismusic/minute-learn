# minute-learn

A toy library designed to implement scikit-learn's interface

### Implemented

- [x] Gradient Descent
- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] PCA
- [x] Decision Tree (vanilla)
- [x] Kmeans Clustering
- [x] Computational graph backpropagation (support for Tensor-like objects)*
- [x] Neural Network support (torch-like interface)*

*Compute graph backprop and neural nets mostly done (needs more testing and features), not available currently.

### Todo

- [ ] Convolution blocks
- [ ] Recurrent blocks
- [ ] SVM
